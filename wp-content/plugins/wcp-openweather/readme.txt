The multilanguage weather forecast plugin based on OpenWeatherMap API that includes various sidebar widgets and shortcodes.

== Description ==     

> **NB!** OpenWeatherMap changed conditions of free API ussage without API Key. Currently, OpenWeatherMap API **doesn't work without API key** any more. You need to add free or paid API key in the plugin settings: "WCP OpenWeather" > "Settings" > "API Key". You can get API key [here](http://openweathermap.org/appid#get).

> **NB!** Usage of the Google Maps APIs now requires a key. If you are using the Google Maps API on localhost or your domain was not active **prior to June 22nd, 2016**, it will require a key going forward. To fix this problem, please see the Google Maps APIs documentation to get a key and add it to your application: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key). You can add this key in the plugin settings: "WCP OpenWeather" > "Settings" > "Google API Key".

WCP OpenWeather plugin allows you to add various widgets and shortcodes with current weather or forecast for your city.   

Our plugin is based on free [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/) and works with free API key for weather data receiving with limitation for this plan, but you can buy any key for [paid plans](http://openweathermap.org/price/) and use it for your purposes.

In additional, plugin supports different themes, but currently is available only one default theme. We are working on creation of new themes for widgets/shortcodes, so it will be added soon. With default theme you are able to customize background/text colors for widgets/shortcodes.

Multilanguage functionality has limitation based on [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/forecast16#multi) languages support, i.e. city name has no translation for city name by default and description of weather conditions have translation only for languages form [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/forecast16#multi) API list.

Currently, translation of the city names realized via Google autocomplete for city name based on active language for the plugin. 

**NB!** Translation of the city name to the active language occurs when you choose city from the Google Autocomplete list. When You change the current language then city name in the existing shortcodes and widgets will not be automatically translated to the new language. To do this, select the city again, and save the changes.
